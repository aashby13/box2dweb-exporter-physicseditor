# box2dweb-exporter-physicseditor
Custom exporter for Box2DWeb and Box2DJS for use with PhysicsEditor from CodeAndWeb

Directions:
Set your custom exporter directory in your preferences for PE.
Place the folder named box2d-js in your custom exporter directory.
After publishing and load the PhysicsData.js to your page, created the bodies like so:
// if you need to adjust the ptm ratio do it before initializing. FYI PhysicsData is in the global scope.
PhysicsData.ptm_ratio = 32;
// initailize PhysicsData
PhysicsData.init();
// created your bodies. args: bodyName, world, bodyType, userData
var brainBody = PhysicsData.createBody('brain', world, Box2D.Dynamics.b2Body.b2_dynamicBody, {sprite:b.bitmap, ratio:32, update:function(b){...}});
